    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="block desc">Kolkata-style chicken biryani is a fragrant rice dish layered with succulent
        chicken pieces, fluffy potatoes, and often, hard-boiled eggs.  Unlike its more 
        robust cousins, it features a milder spice blend, allowing the inherent tastes
        of chicken, fluffy potatoes, and aromatic rice to take center stage. The dish
        is meticulously assembled with alternating layers, then slow-cooked over low
        heat to create a perfect harmony. Subtle floral notes from rosewater and 
        kewra water add a touch of elegance, making this biryani a delightful and 
        fragrant experience.
