    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hailing from Naples, Italy, Neapolitan pizza is known for its simplicity and reliance on fresh, 
        top-notch ingredients. The star is the thin, chewy crust with a hint of char, cooked to 
        perfection in a blazing wood-fired oven. Classic toppings are equally uncomplicated, featuring
        just tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and fragrant basil for the Margherita pizza, or a simple 
        tomato, garlic, and oregano combination for the Marinara. With its focus on quality and
        tradition, Neapolitan pizza is a culinary experience that celebrates fresh flavors and
        age-old techniques

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Dough:</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups (240g) "00" flour (or bread flour), 1/8 tsp instant yeast, and 1/2 tsp granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Gradually add 3/4 cup (170g) lukewarm water (105°F to 115°F), mixing with a dough whisk or your hands until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 1/4 tsp (8g) table salt, knead for 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, ideally overnight.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Sauce:</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Combine 1 cup crushed San Marzano tomatoes (or high-quality canned tomatoes), 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil,
                1 tsp dried oregano, and a pinch of red pepper flakes (optional) in a small bowl. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Assemble:</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightly flour a surface. Stretch dough into a 12-inch round.</li>

            <li>Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil.</li>

        <li><h3>Bake:</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake on a preheated pizza stone (ideally 450-500°F) for 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly with charring.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, bake on a preheated baking sheet for a slightly less crispy crust.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and sea salt flakes. Slice and enjoy immediately!</li>
